<h1 align="center">Hello! Im ToxicFlame427!</h1>
<p>
Hello Hithub! I'm ToxicFlame427 (the name of my online presence) or you can call me Koewen (my real name). I'm a mobile application developer by hobby, and I really want to get a job that revolves around programming (I freaking love doing this stuff man!). I look foreward to working with others on large projects. I am currently studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in college.
You can view the apps I have published on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=ToxicFlame427&c=apps&hl=en">Google Play</a> and on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/koewen-hoffman/id1640324631">iOS App Store</a>!
Visit <a href="https://toxicflame427.xyz">my website</a> to see some more projects I am working on!
</p>
<br>
<p>I just wanted to share below the programming languages that I know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kotlin (My favorite language of all time)</li>
  <li>Dart/Flutter</li>
  <li>C/C++/C# - Basically all of the Cs</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS and XML (Technically not programming languages, they are markup)</li>
  <li>JavaScript (I know only the very basics, my website only uses very small portions of it)</li>
</ul>
