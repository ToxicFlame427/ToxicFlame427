<h1 align="center">Hello! Im ToxicFlame427!</h1>
<p>I am 16 years old, live in the northern USA, and I have been programming for about 5 years now (I dont have any real job experince though)! I had started with HTML and CSS and moved my way up to the more complex languages like C/C++.
The only real reason I learned C/C++ was to build GameBoy games from scratch, which i thought was kind of fun! I would like to do more with C/C++ in the future!
I dabbled a bit with C#, but never really built any real useful programs. The only programs I had build with C# were prank viruses and this little program that gets 
the current position of the cursor every 1/4 of a second. Right now, I am learning Android Development with Kotlin and Android Studio. So far, I have
a few apps already published to Google Play under my username <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=ToxicFlame427&c=apps&hl=en">ToxicFlame427</a> and some of those apps will have
source code repositores here (I highly encourage you to download the app i am most proud of : Opinionator)! So far, I know how to use XML with Kotlin and change XML resources with Kotlin code programatically, how to use
the Firebase Realtime Database, how to build an app from the ground up. I really struggle with the more complicated subjects like Android Permissions and RecyclerAdapters,
but I know if I keep practicing, I will get better eventually! I really enjoy developing Android Apps, however I would like to start doing things with real hardware programming (probably with C/C++)
in the future.</p>
<br>
<p>I am not currently looking for a developer job yet, besides I still have quite a bit to learn. I am always open to ideas though! Please tell me what you think
of my apps and let me know how I can improve them!</p>
<p>I would love to finally stat contributing to other projects and helping other people out! I would love to be invited to help with something made with C#, C/C++, or Kotlin.</p>
<p>Here are the languages I know / currently learning</p>
<ul>
  <li>C/C++ (Would like to use more often)</li>
  <li>Kotlin (Most comfortable with #1)</li>
  <li>C# (Most comfortable with #2)</li>
  <li>Java (Learning)</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>XML</li>
  <li>CSS (I don know much Flexbox or Bootstrap though)</li>
  <li>JavaScript (I know only the basics)</li>
  <li>Ruby (I know very little, I havent used his since I started learning)</li>
</ul>
